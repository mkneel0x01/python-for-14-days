#Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

print("Hello World! This is MK Neel.")
#print(101)
print(3 + 3)
print(2 * 5)  # This is a comment


print("I am", 25, "years old.")


#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")


#Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
#you can add a multiline string (triple quotes """ ) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
